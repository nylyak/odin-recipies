            <p>This cranberry pear crumble pie is a new favorite this time of year. Between those creamy pears, the bursts of tart cranberry, the flaky pie crust, and the buttery brown sugar crumbles—there isn’t a soul on Thanksgiving Day who won’t beg you for this pie recipe. Guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Have I mentioned it’s juicy? All the normal pie squad is here including sugar to sweeten, flour to thicken, cinnamon and ginger for extra yum, and a little squeeze of lemon to keep the flavors bright. Fresh or frozen cranberries work wonders for a ruby red pop of flavor and our FAVORITE pears bring it all home.</p>
